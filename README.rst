Getting Started
=================

mw-plot handy python package to do plotting on a face-on/edge-on milkyway/skymap with `matplotlib` (https://matplotlib.org/) for 
static plots or `bokeh` (https://bokeh.org/) for interactive plots (`bokeh` module under develop).

You can set the center and radius of the plot anywhere on a milkyway galaxy image with galactic or
galactocentric coordinates.

Both ``MW_bg_annotate.jpg`` and ``MW_bg_unannotate.jpg`` are modified from an images by **NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (SSC/Caltech)**
Both images are 5600x5600px with resolution of 24.2 light years per pixel.

``MW_edgeon_edr3_unannotate.jpg`` is modified from an images by **ESA/Gaia/DPAC**.
The image is 6500x3250px with resolution of 15.38 light years per pixel generated by ESA Gaia eDR3.

``mw_plot`` will fill pixels for region outside the pre-compiled images. No acknowledgement to ``mw_plot``
is required if you generate plots for your non-commerical publication, but you **must acknowledgement the origin of
the background images** provided above.
